### Tasks
---

- [x] Recreate the HTML and PHP files (just like in the last section).

- [x] Feel free to copy the code that Dr. Burns provided.

- [x] Login to MySQL from the command line, and insert at least five or so
      additional records. Play around with my new OPAC.

- [x] Journal / document anything I find meaningful about this week's process.

- [x] Format your notes in Markdown and push your notes to GitHub.
      Feel free to add the code that I provide to your GitHub repos, too.
      Be as creative as you want with what you do with Git and GitHub.
