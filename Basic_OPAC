# Week 8: Creating a Bare Bones OPAC

---

## Task

1. Learn how to set up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.

This stack enables us to create a web server that provides extra funtionality via PHP and MySQL, both of which are required to run content management systems and integrated library systems.


### Creating the HTML Page and a PHP Search Page

1. Create the opacbb.html page with script from [Dr. Burns' Systems Librarianship Book](https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/16.5-basic-opac.html)

2. **PHP Search Script**

- Follow the same process as number 1 above but use the PHP Search Script

3. Modifications

- Connect to the MySQL server: **mysql -u opacuser -p**

- Run the insert command with the data for the new records

insert into books
